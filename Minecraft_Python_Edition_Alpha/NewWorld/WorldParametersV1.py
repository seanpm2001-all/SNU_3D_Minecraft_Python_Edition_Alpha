The original Minecraft Java edition has "endless" worlds in it. These worlds are not that big compared to this versions limit
Minecraft Java editions limit is {X: 30,000,000 Y: 256 Z: 30,000,000}
This is the same for bedrock (C) edition
Users can also change this value to whatever they want, but it might not work with certain values
